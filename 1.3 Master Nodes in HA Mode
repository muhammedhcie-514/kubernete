Step 1 Install NGINX and Keepalived.
Run the following command on the three master nodes to install NGINX and Keepalived:
yum install -y nginx keepalived nginx-all-modules
Step 2 Modify the NGINX configuration file.
Add the following content in bold to the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf configuration file of the
three master nodes:
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /usr/share/nginx/modules/*.conf;
events {
 worker_connections 1024;
}
stream {
 log_format main '$remote_addr $upstream_addr - [$time_local] $status
$upstream_bytes_sent';
 access_log /var/log/nginx/k8s-access.log main;
 upstream k8s-apiserver {
 server 192.168.1.11:6443;
 server 192.168.1.12:6443;
 server 192.168.1.13:6443;
 }
 server {
 listen 16443;
 proxy_pass k8s-apiserver;
 }
}


Step 3 Modify the Keepalived configuration file.
Overwrite the /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf configuration file of the k8smaster1
node.
cat > /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf<<EOF
! Configuration File for keepalived
global_defs {
 router_id master1
}
vrrp_instance Nginx {
 state MASTER
 interface ens3
 virtual_router_id 51
 priority 200
 advert_int 1
 authentication {
 auth_type PASS
 auth_pass Huawei@1
 }
 virtual_ipaddress {
 192.168.1.10/24
 }
}
EOF

The configurations of k8smaster2 and k8smaster3 are the same as the preceding
configurations. Note that the value of state must be changed to BACKUP and that of
priority must be reduced. For example, the priority value of k8smaster2 is 150, and
k8smaster3, 100.


Step 4 Start NGINX and Keepalived.
Run the following commands on the three master nodes:
systemctl enable nginx --now
systemctl enable keepalived --now



Step 5 Verify the configuration results.
Run the following commands on the three master nodes and verify that the NGINX and
Keepalived processes are in the active(running) state:
systemctl status nginx
systemctl status keepalived
The VIP 192.168.1.10 is displayed in the IP address of the k8smaster1 node.


The VIP 192.168.1.10 can be pinged on all nodes. Note that if Huawei Cloud Elastic
Cloud Servers (ECSs) are used, disable Source/Destination Check for the NICs of the
ECSs.

Step 6 Verify HA switchover.
Stop the Keepalived service on k8smaster1 and switch the VIP 192.168.1.10 to
k8smaster2.
[root@k8smaster1 ~]# systemctl stop keepalived

Start the Keepalived service on k8smaster1. The VIP 192.168.1.10 returns to k8smaster1
and can be pinged on all nodes.
[root@k8smaster1 ~]# systemctl start keepalived
